#### About
To shed light on recent changes in cross-border value chains in developing Asia, this analysis relies on ADBâ€™s Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) database. This data allows to unpack domestic and cross-border input-output linkages, as well as the value addition composition of trade across sectors and locations.
